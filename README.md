***Rockbuster Stealth LLC***, a former global leader in movie rentals, is transitioning to an online video rental service to remain competitive in the face of industry giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. With a rich catalog of existing movie licenses, Rockbuster aims to leverage its resources to establish itself in the rapidly evolving online entertainment market. As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) team, your role is to analyze the company’s data and provide actionable insights that will inform the strategic decisions needed for a successful launch.

**The project involves several key steps** 

All existing Rockbuster data will be loaded into a relational database management system (RDBMS) to facilitate analysis. This data will then be explored and analyzed using SQL to answer critical business questions posed by the management team.

These questions include:
Ientifying which movies have contributed the most and least to revenue, determining the average rental duration for all videos, and uncovering the geographic distribution of customers. Additionally, the analysis will focus on pinpointing regions with high-lifetime-value customers and assessing whether sales figures vary significantly across different geographic areas.

The findings from this analysis will be summarized and presented to Rockbuster’s management board in an easily digestible format, complete with visualizations and strategic recommendations. Insights into customer behavior, revenue drivers, and geographic trends will guide the company in targeting high-value customers, optimizing rental policies, and tailoring marketing strategies to specific regions. This data-driven approach will enable Rockbuster to effectively position itself as a competitive player in the online streaming industry and drive its success in the digital marketplace.
